    		<h1>The <span class="highlight">History</span> of Bungee</h1>
    		<p>
                According to legend, a woman from the South Pacific invented bungee jumping while getting the better of her man. One of the island natives was mistreating his wife, so she ran away and climbed up into a high banyan tree. When he found her, he climbed up after her. While he was climbing, she tied some vines around her ankles, so when he reached the top and tried to grab her, she jumped–and he jumped with her. The vines saved her from reaching the ground, and he fell to his death. The men in the village then began practicing diving out of the trees with vines attached to their feet, so that no woman should ever get the best of a man again.<br>
                Years later, people would adopt this concept and add a few high-tech features. On April Fool’s Day in 1979, the Oxford ‘Dangerous Sports Club’ attached themselves to elastic bungee cords and jumped off the 245 ft. Clifton Bridge in Bristol, England. The same group would later jump off the Golden Gate Bridge in California, and then from the Royal Gorge Bridge in Colorado in 1980.<br>

                Throughout the ’80s and into the early ’90s, bungee jumping had moved further and further into the mainstream, right up to 1995 with the record-breaking bungee jump in the film Goldeneye. Today, commercial bungee jumping sites can be found all over the world.

    		<h1>What is <span class="highlight">Bungee</span> ?</h1>
    		<p>
    			Bungee jumping is the sport of jumping from extreme heights while attached to an elastic cord from a high platform. The bungee cords allow the jumper to free-fall toward the Earth, and then snap the jumper back up before he hits the ground. It’s the modern-day answer to the primal urge to experience the intense rush of adrenaline. There’s something about forcing your body to do what’s against gut-level human nature, and something stimulating about walking away from a near-death experience intense feeling of being invincible.

    			    		<p>Just your regular old bungee jump. You jump (perhaps in one of the ways described above) and then rebound several times giving you about 2 to 4 great feelings of weightlessness.

    			    		<summary>Catapult</summary>
    			    		<p>
    			    			This is similar to bungee jumping except that you start on the ground. The cord is stretched away from you; when the cord is stretched you are released from the ground. You shoot up into the air at approximately a gagillion miles per hour, eventually stoping and continuing like you would any normal jump.
                                Since the nature of the cord is to pull you towards wherever it is fixed, there is considerable danger that you could shoot into the anchor for the cord (usually a crane cage).

                                Catapult is also known as "Reverse Bungee" and "Bungee Rocket".

    			    		<summary>Twin Tower</summary>
    			    		<p>
    			    			Very similar to a catapult, but they have solved the problem of running into the cord anchor. There are two towers, each with a cord leading to you (in between); the cords are stretched, and you are relased. Since both cords are pulling you, you shoot straight up and then bounce around.
                                Some places use this technique, but you are strapped into a metal cage, and this requires much stronger bungee cords. One company that offers this is Bungee Adventures; they call it the Ejection Seat.

    			    		<summary>Bungee Run</summary>
    			    		<p>
    			    			This isn't 'jumping' per se. The object of bungee running is to run as far away as you can, while a bungee cord pulls you back, eventually you can't pull any more and you give up and get dragged back to where the cord is anchored (as is the way with bungee cords). Usually the bungee run is in a big inflatable (bouncy castle), however it has been known to be right in the middle of a bar with not much to protect you at all.

    			    		<p>
    			    			This is pretty far out there and I'm sure no one really does it, but I found it so hilarious when I learned about it, I had to include it here. I saw it on a TV show in America; it was based on the lives of some mountain rescue people in Colorado I think (kind of like Northern exposure, but based on a mountain rescue team).
                                Anyway, these stoner adrenaline junkies hiked all the way upto the top of a mountain, with their bungee cords and a canoe. They attached one end of the cord to the canoe and the other to the top of the mountain. They all climbed into the canoe and shot down the mountain with the cord behind them.

                                Upon reaching the end of the stretch of the cord, three of them fell out - leaving one poor sucker in the canoe. Just like sandbagging the extra force in the canoe from the three ejected people shot the canoe and sucker at mach 3 UP the hill. Upon reaching the top, the canoe was still moving at a fair old speed and shot right over the top and when it finally came down it was dangling from the cord on a vertical cliff.

    		<h1>Things to <span class="highlight">Jump</span> From</h1>
    		<p>
                
    			Cranes:-
                the cage is on the ground
                jumper is connected to cord which is connected to cage
                sometimes jumpmaster holds the coils of the cords
                the crane lifts up the cage and jumper
                jumper jumps from cage and bounces
                crane slowly lowers cage until jumper is close to ground
                ground crew catch jumper
                crane lowers cage to the ground<br>

                Bridges:-
                jumper is at top of platform or bridge
                jumper is connected to cord, cord is connected to bridge
                jumper jumps from bridge and bounces around
                either:
                a static line is lowered to the jumper who clips it on and jumper is pulled back up to the bridge/platform. (Safest)
                the cord is pulled up via a static line a short distance, disconnected from the bridge and then the jumper and cord is lowered to the ground at the bottom of the bridge

    		<h1><span class="highlight">Safety</span></h1>
    		<p>
    			The next question the potential jumper usually asks is, “How safe is bungee jumping?” Of the millions of jumps that have been done worldwide, there have been relatively few injuries or deaths, and these are rarely attributed to professional, commercial bungee operations, rather to renegade adrenaline junkies trying out new stunts. Minor injuries are very rare as well. These types of injuries would include getting your fingers and skin between metal links or solid parts of the equipment, or a jumper getting hit with the cord, rope, or other hardware. There are usually protective coverings over the joints and padding over the hard parts that are close to the jumper and will protect you from any injury. By using common sense, listening to your instructor and following the instructions, even minor injuries will be rare or nonexistent.
